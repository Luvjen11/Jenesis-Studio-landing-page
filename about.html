        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
         <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>Delving into the world of coding, here are some of my noteworthy projects:</p>
                <h3>Flute Playing</h3>
        <p>I started playing the flute in the first year of middle school and I Have to admit I hated it at first.
          I wanted to learn how to play the guitar or the piano but by the end of the second year I began to feel highly sad.
          That was because the flute I was using belonged to the school so I knew that the year after I would've had to return it back to the school.
          So I started crying out loud to my mum to get me a flute. So after months I convinced her to do so.
          Since I wasn't sure if she would have bought it for me in the main time I registered into the Band of my city because I knew that they would've given me a flute for free if I played with them.
          So that's how I entered the "Banda Musicale di Villadose". I currently play with them now and I intend to attend a conservatory soon to get a qualification too.
          </p>
          <h3>Writing</h3>
         <p>Words have the power to shape worlds. Here's a glimpse into my writing journey:</p>
         <h3>Illustrating</h3>
        <p> I started illustarting in 2019 during the lockdown period. As ususal I thought it would have been great to dedicate that time to learn a new skill. 
          And as always I just learnt the skill thinking it will come useful sometime in my life in my journey to becoming a milionaire.
          With a stroke of the brush or a click of the mouse, I bring visions to life. Explore my illustrated world:</p>
          <h3>Crocheting</h3>
        <p>I started crocheting randomly between the age of 10/11. My reason to this starting this hobby was creating the clothing I couldn't afford back then. 
          It was fun I also organized a fashion show with my dolls at my elementary school.</p>
