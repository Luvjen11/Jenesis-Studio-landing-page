         <h3>Coding</h3>
        <p>I actually never thought I'd start coding because I thought it was something very complicated. 
          Until my school proposed a team project in which we were supposed to build a chatbot.
          We only used deep learning process so I i was curios and decided to go in dept even further.</p>

        <h3>Flute Playing</h3>
        <p>I started playing the flute in the first year of middle school and I Have to admit I hated it at first.
          I wanted to learn how to play the guitar or the piano but I slowly came to realize I was enjoying it.</p>

          <h3>Writing</h3>
         <p> My journey as a writer began as a reader. There's this platform called Wattpad were you are free to write and read people's novel.
          Some writers didn't complete their work so I found myself writing to give the story a closure. </p>

        <p> I started illustarting in 2019 during the lockdown period. As ususal I thought it would have been great to dedicate that time to learn a new skill. 
          And as always I just learnt the skill thinking it will come useful sometime in my life in my journey to becoming a milionaire.</p>

          <h3>Crocheting</h3>
        <p>I started crocheting randomly between the age of 10/11. My reason to this starting this hobby was creating the clothing I couldn't afford back then. 
          It was fun I also organized a fashion show with my dolls at my elementary school.</p>

        <p>
          From childhood dreams to overcoming the fear that once held me back, I understand the struggles. 
          <br>At nineteen, I was determined to succeed, realizing that life is too short to let fear hinder us.
          <br>Jenesis Studio was created to inspire and empower people through art.
          <br> If you're struggling with goals, time management, or self-esteem, know that you are not alone. I have been there too.
          <br>Sometimes, it's not about changing the goal; it's about changing the plan.
